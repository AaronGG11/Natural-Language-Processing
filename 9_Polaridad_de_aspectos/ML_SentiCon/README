ML-SENTICON: Multilingual, layered sentiment lexicons at lemma level

This resource contains lemma-level sentiment lexicons at lemma level for English, Spanish, Catalan, Basque and Galician. For each lemma, it provides an estimation of polarity (from very negative -1.0 to very positive +1.0), and a standard deviation (related with ambiguity of the polarity estimation, please refer to paper for further details).

List of files included:

- senticon.xx.xml: lemma-level lexicons, where "xx" is the language identifier (en: English, es: Spanish, ca: Catalan, eu: Basque, gl: Galician). Each lexicon contains 8 layers. Each layer is supposed to contain all the previous layers, but only new lemmas are included in the corresponding xml elements.
- synset-level-pos-neg: synset-level estimations of positivity and negativity. Same format as SentiWordNet 3.0.
